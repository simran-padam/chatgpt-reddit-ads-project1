In this project, we perform text mining of Reddit comments on ChatGPT. We attempt topic modelling to uncover the underlying themes in the text documents. For Sentiment Analysis, VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is applied to generate sentiment scores on the comments. Using sentiment scores as ground truth, text classification methodologies such as Logistic regression, Naive Bayes are used with the aim to compare different modelling techniques.
